# Overview

In this project, you'll design a RISC-V ALU. RISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA) that defines the functions a computer can carry out through assembly instructions. An ALU, or arithmetic and logic unit, performs many of the core computations dictated by those instructions. So in short, you'll be building a key component of a CPU.
