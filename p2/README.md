# Overview

In this project, you'll implement a single-cycle processor in Logisim. Your processor will support a small subset of the RISCV instruction set, including arithmetic, logic and memory operations. You'll also write a test file and a small byte reversal program, both in RISCV, to ensure your processor's correctness. Also, to introduce to you (and hopefully better familiarize yourself with) the RISC-V assembly instructions, you will create your very own byte reversal program using the instructions that you will later implement for your processor in Logisim.
