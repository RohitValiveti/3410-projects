# Overview

In this project, you will exploit several users on the Linux Virtual Machine we've given you.
This means that you will exploit vulnerabilities in code either available or running on this machine to take over these users' accounts, or otherwise leak secret values they're trying to protect.

Executing another buffer overflow attack that requires slightly more careful inputs.
Executing a memory safety vulnerability that causes the program to leak a secret to the user when it should not do so
